# ML-Based-Optimization-of-Matrix-Multiplication

Project Title: ML-Based Optimization of Matrix Multiplication Performance Using Reinforcement Learning

Project Objective:
The goal of this project is to optimize matrix multiplication using Reinforcement Learning (RL), where an agent learns to partition matrices and compute products in an optimized way based on hardware and computational constraints. This will be compared to traditional matrix multiplication methods, including the naive and Strassen’s algorithms.

1. Problem Definition
	• Goal: Matrix multiplication is a fundamental operation in AI, and optimizing it can significantly reduce computational time and resource consumption.
	• Objective: Use RL to optimize matrix multiplication by determining the best way to partition matrices for faster computation, minimizing time and memory usage.

2. Data Collection
	• Matrix Generation: You will generate different types of matrices (dense, sparse, square, rectangular) with varying sizes. Examples:
		○ Dense square matrices of size 100x100, 500x500, etc.
		○ Sparse matrices with 10% of non-zero entries.
	• Benchmarking Data: For each matrix type and size, benchmark traditional matrix multiplication (naive O(n^3), Strassen's algorithm, etc.) and record the computation time and memory usage.
	• Performance Metrics: Use time (execution time) and memory (RAM usage) as metrics for evaluating the performance of matrix multiplication algorithms.

3. Choosing Reinforcement Learning (RL) Approach
	• State Space: The state is represented by the matrix size (e.g., 4x4, 256x256), the sparsity of the matrix (dense or sparse), and the partitioning options for each matrix multiplication task.
	• Action Space: Actions are the strategies for partitioning the matrix (e.g., dividing the matrix into blocks, choosing specific multiplication methods like Strassen’s, or adjusting parallelization).
	• Reward Function: The reward is based on the performance metrics (time and memory). The reward will be positive if the optimization reduces time or memory usage compared to traditional methods.
	• RL Algorithm: Use Q-learning or Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) for training the RL agent. This will help the agent explore the best ways to optimize matrix multiplication.

4. PyTorch Implementation Setup
	• Reinforcement Learning with PyTorch:
		○ Create a custom environment for matrix multiplication optimization using gym (Python library for RL).
		○ State Representation: Each state could include information like matrix dimensions and properties.
		○ Action Representation: The agent can choose various strategies for splitting the matrices and choosing multiplication methods (traditional or Strassen’s).
		○ Reward Calculation: Implement a reward system that rewards faster computations and lower memory usage.
	• Matrix Multiplication Algorithms:
		○ Implement the traditional Naive Matrix Multiplication (O(n^3)).
		○ Implement Strassen’s Algorithm for comparison.
		○ Implement matrix multiplication using block partitioning for parallelism (as one possible strategy to optimize).

5. Training the RL Agent
	• Training Loop:
		○ Use the Q-learning or PPO algorithm to train your agent.
		○ The agent will interact with the matrix multiplication environment, choosing actions that maximize the reward.
		○ Over time, the agent will learn optimal strategies for matrix multiplication based on size, sparsity, and partitioning options.
	• Hyperparameters: Tune learning rates, exploration-exploitation trade-offs (epsilon-greedy for Q-learning), and the discount factor.

6. Evaluation
	• Benchmark Results: After training the RL agent, test it on unseen matrices and evaluate how well it performs compared to traditional algorithms. Measure:
		○ Execution time.
		○ Memory consumption.
	• Performance Comparison: Plot graphs comparing the performance of your RL agent against the naive matrix multiplication and Strassen’s algorithm on various matrix types and sizes.

7. Visualization and Deployment
	• Interactive Visualization:
		○ Create a simple web-based dashboard or a command-line tool where users can input matrix dimensions and sparsity.
		○ Display the matrix multiplication time and memory usage, along with the RL agent’s selected optimization strategy.
	• Real-Time Performance:
		○ Show real-time optimization and performance improvements with the AI model.
	• Deployment Options:
		○ Deploy the model on a server or cloud platform (AWS, GCP, etc.) for testing on larger matrices.

8. Documentation
	• Code Documentation: Make sure all your code is well-commented and organized into clear functions and modules.
	• Project Report: Write a comprehensive report detailing the:
		○ Problem background.
		○ Approach to optimizing matrix multiplication using RL.
		○ Results of performance comparison.
		○ Challenges encountered during implementation.
	• Project Presentation: Prepare a slide deck summarizing the project, including the motivation, methodology, key findings, and potential applications.
